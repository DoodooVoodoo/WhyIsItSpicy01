- 👋 Hi, I’m @WhyIsItSpicy01
- NOTE: I'm so confused on how Github works lol. this is fun. imma just click on stuff.....
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code in general to be able to create my ideas that I have myself own my own time on my own terms. I am here to learn at my own pace and to ask questions and to meet people that know this computer language world. I am in the I.T. Industry and I'm very knowledgeable as a tech and engineer. Fixing hardware and software is no problem for me. I howver am interested in the guts of all this software I work with.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning nothing. I am exploring reading absorbing. I do this before I dive in. I am interested in Python primarily as well as HTML, PHP, Javascript, Powershell, BASH and other languages that are commonly used.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the time. I am open to Looking at projects however I am in no position knowledge wise to be beneficial at this time. I am however full of ideas. They come to me endlessly most of the time. I am always open to providing unbiased critizism in the spirit of making something better. I'm just here to learn for now. I know nothing about github I just download game mods from here most of the time lol.
- 📫 How to reach me. Well unless we are cool I'd prefer professional communications via my email. I Don't even know if Github has a messaging system currently.
